1)  Add support for displacement and reg to mem operations         See 7  
2a) Sign extending an immed val is not working; check the sign
    extend logic                                                   FIXED
2b) Sign extend not returning right values for offsets. Changed
    the logic which checks if MSB is set or not                    FIXED
3)  Useless opcodes are being printed. Find and fix them.          FIXED
4)  Add support for the following instructions: cqto, lea, sar, 
    neg                                                            FIXED
5)  Opsize for the first 128 bits of instructions is wrong. 
    Size_bytes is not not getting dequeued correctly.              FIXED
6)  Address in 'address' field of uop incorrect                    FIXED
7)  Check if there are any instructions other than lea that uses
    base, scale and index registers.                               See 9
8)  Prepending incomplete bytes is not correct. It blindly 
    prepends the rem_string to bit_stream.                         FIXED
9)  Opcodes without a base register [in (base,index,scale) scheme]
    is not handled.                                                FIXED
10) Add extra src_types (IMUL_1, IMUL_2, IMUL_3, 
    IMMED_PC_RELATIVE)                                             FIXED
